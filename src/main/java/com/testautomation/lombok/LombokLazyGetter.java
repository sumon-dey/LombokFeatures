import lombok.Getter;

/* You can let lombok generate a getter which will calculate a value once, 
 * the first time this getter is called, and cache it from then on. This can be useful
 *  if calculating the value takes a lot of CPU, or the value takes a lot of memory. 
 *  To use this feature, create a private final variable, initialize it with the expression 
 *  that's expensive to run, and annotate your field with @Getter(lazy=true). 
 *  The field will be hidden from the rest of your code, and the expression will be 
 *  evaluated no more than once, when the getter is first called. There are no magic
 *   marker values (i.e. even if the result of your expensive calculation is null, the result
 *    is cached) and your expensive calculation need not be thread-safe, as lombok takes 
 *    care of locking.

If the initialization expression is complex, or contains generics, we recommend moving 
the code to a private (if possible static) method, and call that instead. */
